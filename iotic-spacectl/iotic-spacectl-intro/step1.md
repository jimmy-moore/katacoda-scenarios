# Create a twin

To get started with Iotics, you can use spacectl.

## Configure

First, we need to point spacectl at a space, and tell it to configure itself.

`./iotic-spacectl init --host plateng.iotics.space`{{execute}}

In the above step, spacectl creates a configuration file which contains a new user identity. Keep it safe!
The default output location is `~/.spacectl.yaml` but you can specify this with `--config <file>`.

Lets take a very quick look at the config file
`cat .spacectl.yaml`{{execute}}

The identity configuration here means that anything you create from here on in will be owned by YOU.

## Create a twin

To create a twin, we need to give the twin some data. This is best done with json.
There just so happens to be an example of what that might look like. Lets take a look!

`cat example-twin.json`{{execute}}

A line of json, and then a feedname at the end (TODO: This will change)

Lets get spacectl to create it!

`cat example-twin.json | ./iotic-spacectl createtwins --host plateng.iotics.space`{{execute}}

You might notice the `--host plateng.iotics.space` argument. This tells spacectl which space you want to create your twins in.
If you want to create several of each twin piped into spacectl, you can use `--num`. Lets try that!

`cat example-twin.json | ./iotic-spacectl createtwins --host plateng.iotics.space --num 12 | tee dozen_twins`{{execute}}

When your twin is created, it's given a unique ID. In the above line, we save the output into the file `dozen_twins` just so we keep
track of these twin ids.
To make some future steps easier, lets grab out the twin IDs from that output.

`cat dozen_twins | grep CREATED | awk '{print $4}' > dozen_twin_ids

Congratulations! You just created your first 13 twins!
But how do we know they're actually there on the space? We can use describetwin with the IDs that we saved.

`cat dozen_twin_ids | ./iotic-spacectl describetwins --host plateng.iotics.space`{{execute}}

But what if we don't know the IDs? We can do a search. In the twin json, we defined a tag - "JMTWIN". Lets use that.
There's lots of ways to search so don't worry about the exact query syntax for now.

`echo {"filter": {"text": "JMTWIN"}, "responseType": "FULL"} | ./iotic-spacectl searchtwins --host plateng.iotics.space`{{execute}}

We also created a feed on each of these twins, so let's look at feeds next!
