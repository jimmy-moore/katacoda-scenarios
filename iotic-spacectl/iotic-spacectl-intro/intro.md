# Introduction to iotics using spacectl

This scenario will get you started with iotics.

Before we dive in, lets go over some basics.

Iotics is all about digital twins. These twins are digital copies of physical assets.

Twins have metadata which can be set and updated. They can also have feeds for when
a feed of data is more appropriate.

For example, if you have a fleet of taxis, you might model each taxi as a digital twin.
You might have metadata describing the type of car, age, model, whether it's busy or not, etc
Then you might add a feed to share the location.

All of these twins exist within an Iotic space.

They can interact with each other, but they can also interact with other twins from other companies, or
twins of public data within the iotics platform, such as weather data, etc.

So in the above example, if you want to control a taxi fleet, you might want to also take into consideration
road congestion, weather forecasts, football events, train times, etc to ensure your taxis are in the right
places at the right times. You can do all this with Iotics.

So lets jump in and start using iotics!
