# I like KFC

This scenario will show how easy it is to get data into iotics.

I like KFC. I need to know where all the KFC outlets are.

Oh did I mention, you can give twins a location, and then search within the portal
for twins close to a gps location.

OK, so where are we going to find a list of KFC restaurants?
It turns out, the gov food ratings data is good enough https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-gb
